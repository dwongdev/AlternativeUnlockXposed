# AlternativeUnlockXposed
Unlock your Android phone with an alternative PIN. (Xposed, Root)

This app provides an reliable way to run something when providing a specific, wrong PIN on your Android lock screen.

Unlike [Duress](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.lucky.duress&hl=en&gl=US), this app uses Xposed Framework so you can also unlock your phone with a wrong PIN, preventing some *social engineering vulunability* :)

## Feature

- Alternative PIN to unlock phone
- Run command on alternative PIN, with root
- Easy to use user interface


Currently tested on Android 14 only. Note this is an Xposed app, so it may not work on older Android versions.
